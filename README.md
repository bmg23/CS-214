Calvin College Computer Science 214 - Programming Language Concepts
  
  
  Welcome to my GitHub repository for class projects!
  
  The goal of this course was to learn more about the different ways to program. 
  Each week we takled a new challenge in four different languages; Java, Ada, Clojure
  and Ruby. The largest project and one that incorporated the most concepts was Project 08. 
  
  
  As for the final project...Still to come.
